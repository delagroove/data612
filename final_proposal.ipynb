    "\n",
    "For the final project I want to build a recommender system for yelpers, using the [Yelp Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/download). It's almos 9Gb of user and review data, photos metadata and check-ins if any.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the dataset is of a correct size to be worked on Pyspark as a beginner. so i will use Apache spark in a local cluster. i will extend that architecture to use apache mesos as suggested architecture in [PaperSpace for pyspark](https://github.com/Paperspace/jupyter-docker-stacks/tree/master/pyspark-notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to apply all concepts learned about recommender systems architecture and deploy a Spark cluster that returns restaurant recommendations, Analyze its performance and if the advantages/overkill of setting up such work in your company when you have limited data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges \n",
    "\n",
    "The time is a bit short for learning Spark, but the Jupyter notebook and the look and feel of the server option helps to kickstart the process. I also worry a bit about a bad algo overflowing and hiiting hard my wallet, but the 9gb dataset is safe to make it start locally.\n",
